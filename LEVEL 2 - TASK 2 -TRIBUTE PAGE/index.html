            Chandra Vidyasagar's Institution and later at the Presidency College
            in Calcutta. He was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and
            science. He had an interest in music both instrumental as well as
            vocal. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling, and
            bodybuilding. He was also fond of reading and by the time he had

          <h2>Ram Krishna Ashram Mission</h2>
          <p>
            He founded Ramakrishna Mission Around 1897, he returned to India and
            reached Calcutta where he founded Ramakrishna Mission on 1 May 1897
            at Belur Math. The goals of the mission were based on Karma Yoga and
            its main objective was to serve the poor and suffering or disturbed
            population of the country. Several social services are also
            performed under this mission like establishing schools, colleges,
            and hospitals. Teachings of Vedanta were also provided through
            conferences, seminars, and workshops, rehabilitation work across the
            country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us tell you that Vivekananda's teachings were mostly based on
            Ramakrishna's spiritual teachings of Divine manifestations and his
            personal internalization of the Advaita Vedanta Philosophy.
            According to him, the ultimate goal of life is to achieve the
            freedom of the soul and that encompasses the entirety of one's
            religion.

          <h2>Swami g - Achievements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The biggest achievement of Swamiji will be the re-introduction of
              the ancient spirituality of our country back to us. Each
              commentary by him is a bigger essence of the truth which is part
              of our Vedic knowledge
            </li>
            <li>
              One of his essays , “ Six lessons on Raj yoga, “ is a intensive
              Raj yogic process that can make one know what God is.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1893, he started his speech by saying “Bhaiyo aur Beheno” in
              Chicago, and received a huge applauds from audience. He was not
              ashamed of using Hindi and I think we all should learn from him.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1897, he predicted that India will get freedom after 50 years
              and it happened. Amazing, isn’t it?

          <h2>Last moments of life</h2>
          <p>
            9:00 pm: The Swami was lying face up.He turned on his left side. For
            a few second his right hand shook slightly. There were beads of
            perspiration on his forehead. Then he began to cry like a baby.
          </p>
          <p>
            9:02-9:10 pm: He exhaled a deep breath. He remained still for 2
            minutes and then he again exhaled a deep breadth. His head shook and
            then fell off from the pillow. His eyes became still and an
            unearthly glow began to emit from his smiling face.
            </p>
            <p> 9:30 pm:
            Everyone came running in thinking that the Swami has enetered
            Samadhi. Swami Bodhananda checked the pulse and then began crying.
            One person told someone to immediately bring Dr. Mahendra Majumdar
            to the Belur Math. Swamis Premananda and Nischayananda started to
            recite Ramakrishna's name in the Swami's ears to bring him down from
            Samadhi.</p>
            <p>10:30 pm: Dr. Majumdar, Swamis Brahmananda and Saradananda
            came almost at the same time to Belur Math. Baikuntha Sanyal also
            came. Dr. Majumdar examined the body and saw the heart has stopped.
            He tried to artificially stimulate the heart.</p> 
            <p>
                 12:am: Dr. Majumdar
            informed the inmates that the Swamiji has passed away. His diagnosis
            was that stoppage of the heart caused the death of the Swami.
            Vivekananda lived 39 years 5 months and 24 days. He has kept his
            word since he had told his intimates that he will not see 40.
            </p>
             About
            3 months before his death (28 March 1902) the Swami told his
            disciple Nivedita that 'he has given everything that he could give.
            Now he will have to go'. Two days before his death he told his
            intimates that the spiritual power in Belur will create a powerful
            movement for 1500 years. Three days before his death (1st July 1902)
            while walking the grounds of the Belur Math the Swami showed his
            disciples a spot on the bank of the Ganga and told them to cremate
            his body there.
